# The steps

Every step is a Makefile target over one script; every script says what it does at the top.

1. **`make lite-image`** -- downloads the two DoltLite packages of the release `versions.json` names into
   `build/doltlite/`, checks them against the recorded sha256, builds `doltsamples-doltlite:<version>`.
   Needed by every later step of the SQLite pair (the image carries both shells) and by the
   PostgreSQL pair's helper (`wipe`).
2. **`make export-pairs`** -- with sql-megasamples' stack up (`make -C ../sql-megasamples up`;
   `megasamples-postgres` is the source of the PostgreSQL dumps, its `build/sqlite/` the source of
   the files): `pg_dump` in three forms and a reference per database into `build/dumps/postgres/`;
   the `.sqlite` file, its `.dump`, its `.schema` and a reference into `build/dumps/sqlite/`.
   `ARGS="--only sakila"` restricts it; a database already exported is skipped without `--force`.
3. **`make preflight-pairs`** -- every exported schema into throwaway PostgreSQL, DoltgreSQL,
   SQLite and DoltLite; the table of refusals and `build/preflight/pairs.json`. The gate: a
   refusal not yet covered by a dialect rule or recorded as accepted goes into
   `scripts/doltgres_dialect.py` / `scripts/doltlite_dialect.py` before any row is loaded. The
   preflight loads no rows, so a refusal that only shows at row time is found by the loads.
4. **Stop everything else.** `make down` here and in the sql-megasamples checkout; `run_pairs.py`
   refuses to time loads beside other stacks (`--allow-busy` overrides, and the numbers then say
   nothing).
5. **`make run-pg`** and **`make run-lite`** -- the five shapes, resumable, cheapest-first,
   `ARGS="--max-rows N"` to keep a pass short, `ARGS="--indexes inline"` for the second policy,
   `ARGS="--redo --only pubs"` to measure a unit again after a dialect change (both engines of the
   pair, since both load the changed file), `ARGS="--skip-row-by-row employees"` to leave a database's
   four row-by-row shapes out of a run (its one-shot shapes still run; repeat the flag for more
   databases). Progress in `build/progress.json`; `make progress`.
6. **`make report`** -- folds the units into `build/results.json` (`collect_pairs.py`), regenerates
   `README.md`, `JOURNAL.md`, `REPORT.md` and the landing page; **`make check`** fails if any
   document disagrees with the measurements or an invariant fails (`audit.py`).
7. **`make up`** then **`make test-stack`** -- the stack with DoltgreSQL and the DoltLite files
   beside Dolt, and the proof that both accounts, every file and every console answer.

# How the first run was sequenced (2026-09-10)

The quick subset (`make -C ../sql-megasamples list-quick`, 15 databases) first, under
`--max-rows 200000`, every shape of both pairs and both policies, so that complete tables existed
before any long load started; then the stack test; then the export and preflight of the six
remaining databases; then the quick subset up to a million rows; then the one-commit shapes of
everything; then the per-row shapes of the largest databases, cheapest first, for as long as the
night lasted. The drivers were two shell scripts under `build/` (gitignored), each a sequence of
the commands above; a run interrupted anywhere resumes with the same command.

The second run, after every unit was measured again with method 2, goes smallest first in three
steps (up to 200,000 rows, up to a million, then everything), the SQLite pair before the PostgreSQL
pair and both index policies in each step, with `--skip-row-by-row employees` throughout: the
maintainer decided that employees' row-by-row loads, about 29 hours of machine time, come last, once
every other result is in.

# What to do when a unit records an error

`build/progress.json` keeps the error, every refusal with its line and the object it fell in, and
the index-parity report. A row-count shortfall is a refused row: look at `errors` for the
`TABLE DATA` object, reproduce it on a throwaway server (`docker run --rm -e DOLTGRES_PASSWORD=x
dolthub/doltgresql@<digest>`), decide whether a dialect rule can carry the data without touching a
row, record the finding in the engine's tool record, and rerun the unit with `--redo`. A missing
index the engine refused out loud is recorded as a schema object not taken and is not an error.

# Moving an engine to a newer version (2026-09-12)

One version per run, and no pins ([the decision](/decisions/engine-versions-one-per-result-set.md)): every
unit records its engine's version, a run never mixes two, and a new run starts on the newest releases.

1. `make versions` -- each engine's version beside the newest release upstream. Nothing moves on its own.
2. `make new-run` -- `scripts/versions.py --latest` resolves the newest release of all six engines (Dolt
   and DoltgreSQL: the GitHub release's image, pulled and resolved to its digest; DoltLite: the release's
   packages, downloaded fresh and checked against its digests; MySQL and PostgreSQL: the newest version tag
   of the official Docker Hub image, by digest; SQLite: sqlite.org's newest release tarball, checked against
   the SHA3-256 its download page names), rewrites `versions.json` and the compose defaults, and drops from
   `build/progress.json` and the memory studies every record of an engine that moved (the repository's
   history keeps the old run); then `make lite-image --record` builds the DoltLite image with the SQLite
   shell from source and records what the image carries. It refuses while a runner holds `build/run.lock`:
   a run keeps its versions until it is complete.
3. The runs: `make run`, `make run-pg`, `make run-lite`, both index policies, `make memory-pairs`. A runner
   refuses before writing anything if any recorded unit of an engine it touches is on another version, over
   the whole result set and not only the run's scope; the collectors withdraw such units' numbers, and
   `make check` fails if a document carries another version's number or study. The baseline engine of a
   pair is measured again only if its own version changed.
4. `make report`, then a new tool record for the version (what was verified on it) and an **Update** in
   `log.md`; `make up` serves the new version, because the stack reads `versions.json`.

Done once so far: DoltLite v0.50.9 to v0.50.10 on 2026-09-12, every DoltLite unit measured again.
