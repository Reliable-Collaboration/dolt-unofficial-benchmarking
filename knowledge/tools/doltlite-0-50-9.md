title: DoltLite v0.50.9
description: The SQLite fork with a versioned storage engine that the SQLite pair measured from 2026-09-10 to 2026-09-12 at v0.50.9, named by the checksums of its Debian packages and built here into an image from them, with what was verified by replaying sakila into it before the experiment ran; superseded by v0.50.10 on 2026-09-12, every DoltLite unit measured again.

# Facts

**Superseded on 2026-09-12** by [DoltLite v0.50.10](/tools/doltlite-0-50-10.md) under [one version per result set](/decisions/engine-versions-one-per-result-set.md): the numbers taken on v0.50.9 are kept under `superseded` in `build/progress.json` and no longer shown. This record stays as the account of the version the first DoltLite result set was measured on.

DoltLite v0.50.9 is pinned: it stays until the maintainer explicitly asks for the pin to be removed ([the pin](/decisions/doltlite-version-pin.md)). Everything below was observed on 2026-09-10 with the image `docker/doltlite/Dockerfile` builds: `debian:13-slim` (digest `sha256:d7e12182ce18b85b93007c1dedf31f2d29e01ccf3182cc4017c709b6259bc132`) plus `libdoltlite0_0.50.9_amd64.deb` and `doltlite_0.50.9_amd64.deb` (checksums in the release record), plus Debian's `sqlite3` package. Licence: Apache-2.0 for the DoltLite extensions over public-domain SQLite.

* **Identity.** `doltlite -version` answers `DoltLite v0.50.9 (SQLite 3.54.0, 64-bit)`; `SELECT dolt_version()` answers `v0.50.9`. The shell is SQLite's shell (`-help` lists SQLite's options; `.read`, `.dump`, `.schema` work). It links glibc 2.38: on `debian:12-slim` (glibc 2.36) it refuses to start (`GLIBC_2.38' not found`), on Debian 13 (glibc 2.41) it runs.
* **A stock SQLite file is not versioned.** Opening sql-megasamples' `sakila.sqlite` with `doltlite` answers plain queries (film 1,000) but `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dolt_log` answers `dolt version-control features are not available on stock SQLite databases`. A DoltLite-format file is not a SQLite file: `sqlite3 sakila.doltlite` answers `file is not a database (26)`. Hence [the "same file" decision](/decisions/doltlite-same-file.md).
* **The dump replays.** `sqlite3 sakila.sqlite .dump` (5,228,218 bytes, 48,317 INSERTs) read by `doltlite sakila.dl ".read ..."` produced no error; afterwards film 1,000, payment 16,044, rental 16,044; `sqlite_schema` 21 tables, 27 indexes, 24 triggers, 6 views -- the same as the source. Triggers fire (an UPDATE that changes a name moves `last_update` on both engines to the same second); views answer (`film_list` 1,000; `sales_by_store` 2); FTS5 works (`MATCH 'drama'` answers 106 on both), including in a file created fresh (`CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE t USING fts5(a)`). `PRAGMA index_list` / `index_info` answer as SQLite's do.
* **Commits and VACUUM.** `SELECT dolt_commit('-Am', 'msg')` returns a hash; `SELECT dolt_commit('-A', '--allow-empty', '-m', 'msg')` too; `dolt_log` counts them (a fresh file starts with one). `VACUUM` is garbage collection and the difference is large: sakila replayed inside the dump's single transaction was 8,756,887 bytes, 8,541,254 after `VACUUM` (the stock file is 5,251,072); replayed with every statement autocommitted it was 319,067,787 bytes before and 8,541,014 after; replayed with a `dolt_commit` after every INSERT (47,269 commits, 29.1 s, about 1,600 commits per second in-process) it was 411,235,360 bytes before `VACUUM`.
* **Timing, one sample.** The single-transaction replay of sakila's dump: 150 ms in `doltlite`, 100 ms in `sqlite3`; autocommitted: 1,054 ms and 792 ms. One sample each on the shared machine; the timed runs are the measurement.
* **Dolt Workbench opens the files.** The pinned Workbench image (built 2026-08-24) bundles `@dolthub/doltlite` 0.11.51, whose `dolt_version()` answers `doltlite-amalgamation` on SQLite 3.54.0; it opened a v0.50.9 file (`jaffle_shop.doltlite`, storage format 12) read-only and read-write, answering `dolt_log`, the tables, the `main` branch and both commits through the Workbench's API (2026-09-10). One file is one connection, named by a `file://` URL inside the Workbench's container.
* **Foreign keys.** `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is honoured as in SQLite: off by default (an orphan row is accepted), enforced when on (`FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`). The dump's `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` therefore applies to both engines.
* **Errors do not stop a script.** Both `doltlite` and `sqlite3` report a failing statement of a `.read` script and continue (a 4-statement script with a bad third statement leaves 2 rows in both).

# Limits

Found by refusal on sakila's dump and on the quick subset's schemas (2026-09-10); each is a dialect rule applied to both engines of the pair, so that the comparison stays between engines:

* **A table is committed only when every table its foreign keys name exists.** With `staff` (which references `store`) dumped before `store`, `dolt_commit` after a `staff` row answers `foreign key on table `staff` requires the referenced table `store`` until `store` is created -- the rows go in, the commits are lost. Rule L1 puts every `CREATE TABLE` ahead of the first `INSERT`: [dialect rules](/decisions/pair-dialect-rules.md).
* **The dump's virtual-table registration only works inside the dump's own transaction.** `.dump` registers an FTS5 table by `INSERT INTO sqlite_schema(...)` under `PRAGMA writable_schema=ON`; run as its own statement, both engines answer `table sqlite_master may not be modified`, and once the virtual table exists first, both refuse the dump's shadow-table rows (`object name reserved for internal use`). Rule L2 creates the virtual table with `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE`, drops the shadow-table statements and rebuilds the index after the rows (or, under the inline policy, keeps it in step with the port's sync triggers).
* **Version gap to the baseline.** The fork's base is SQLite 3.54.0, ahead of the newest SQLite release (3.53.4 on 2026-09-10); the stock shell beside it is Debian 13's 3.46.1: [sqlite3 shell](/tools/sqlite3-shell-3-46-1.md).
* **`VACUUM` fails on the larger per-row-commit files, and the failure is DoltLite's own.** dvdstore with the indexes inline (174,718 commits, 5,170,967,610 bytes before the settle step), chicago_crimes (260,043 commits, 3,626,990,331 bytes), lahman and contoso (about 15 GB each) all answered `Error in 2nd command line argument: out of memory` to `VACUUM` within seconds; on a copy of the chicago_crimes file the shell's anonymous memory peaked at 1,165 MiB under a 16 GiB cgroup and the answer was the same with no cap at all, with `soft_heap_limit` and `hard_heap_limit` at 0 (2026-09-10). dvdstore under the deferred policy (1,823,235,885 bytes) collected in 5.4 s and enron (410,260,509 bytes) in 1.5 s, so the limit sits between 1.8 GB and 3.6 GB for these files. Such a unit is kept with `settled: false`, its size marked as the working footprint in the tables and left out of the totals: [answered question](/questions/doltlite-vacuum-memory.md). Reported on 2026-09-11 as dolthub/doltlite issue 2820 with a reproduction repository; DoltHub closed it as fixed the same day (pull request 2836, the mark queue bounded and spilled to disk) and released the fix in v0.50.10 that evening, which this repository does not use while the pin stands ([the release](/sources/doltlite-release-v0-50-10.md), [patch or work around](/decisions/engine-bugs-patch-or-work-around.md)). By 2026-09-12 nine per-row-commit units carried `settled: false`.
* **Durability per autocommitted statement**: one `fdatasync` per statement (319 for 312 autocommitted `INSERT`s, against `sqlite3`'s four per statement), measured with `strace` on 2026-09-10: [answered question](/questions/doltlite-durability-per-statement.md).
* No container image is published; the one here is built by `make lite-image` and never pushed.
