"""Check the experiment's numbers against things that must be true, and fail if they are not.

  python3 scripts/audit.py [--strict]

Every check here exists because something in this experiment failed by producing a *plausible*
value rather than an error. That is the failure mode worth engineering against: a load that stops
early still leaves a directory, a truncated query still returns a number, a `du` that fails still
returns something an arithmetic expression will accept.

The one that prompted this file: row counts were built as a single `UNION ALL` over every table
using `GROUP_CONCAT`, whose default `group_concat_max_len` of 1024 bytes silently cut the generated
SQL mid-statement. `adventureworks`, with 69 tables, reported 142,002 rows against an actual
759,240. Nothing errored. The wrong number was then used in an argument about what Dolt's memory
scales with -- and the check that would have caught it instantly was available the whole time, in
the same table: a load that commits once per row must end with as many commits as it has rows.

So the checks are invariants, not spot values. An invariant does not need to be updated when the
numbers change, cannot be satisfied by a plausible-looking wrong answer, and says which measurement
disagrees with which. They are cheap; run them after every run.
