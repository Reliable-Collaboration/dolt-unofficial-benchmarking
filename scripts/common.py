# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- memory ---
# WSL2 gave this host 15.5 GB and ran out of it. Nothing here was bounded: the loads created a
# container per mode and never removed them, so up to seven were alive at once, and a `dolt sql`
# building a multi-million-commit history will take whatever it can reach -- which under WSL2 means
# the whole VM, not just the container.
#
# Every container this repository starts now carries an explicit ceiling, and the run keeps at most
# one worker alive beside the source server. The budget totals 9.25 GB, which is what this host can
# give up without the rest of it suffering.
#
#   source MySQL   1 GB   only needed to answer the row checks; it is *stopped* during a Dolt load
#   one worker    the rest, sized from this host: MemTotal less 2.5 GB for the host and the helper
#   helper       256 MB   the short-lived `du` and `rm -rf` containers
#
# The worker's share is computed rather than written down, because the right number is a property of
# the machine. On this host WSL2 takes its default half of 31.7 GB, and raising that in .wslconfig
# raises the worker with it without touching any code.
#
# The worker gets 12 GB because nothing else is running while it works. The dumps are a bind mount
# and the source server is not consulted between the first statement and the last, so it is stopped
# for the duration of a Dolt load and started again for the row-count verification that follows.
# That is not a saving of 1 GB but of everything the source server holds -- and it costs only the
# twenty seconds it takes to come back, which falls outside the timed section.
#
# --memory-swap set equal to --memory turns swap off for the container. That matters more than the
# ceiling on WSL2: a process allowed to swap does not fail, it drags the whole VM down with it.
