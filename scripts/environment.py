"""Record the machine the measurements were taken on.

  python3 scripts/environment.py

Timings are meaningless without the machine that produced them, and sizes are only meaningful if the
engine versions and settings are known. This writes `build/environment.json` and prints a table for
the README, generated rather than typed so it describes the machine that actually ran the tests.

Neither engine is performance-tuned. Both run their published images with stock storage settings,
and MySQL is started with two flags, recorded here rather than described away; the only
non-default flags are the ones needed to load at all (`--local-infile=1`, `--skip-log-bin` on the
timing MySQL). A tuned MySQL — compressed row format, a different page size, a larger buffer pool —
would produce different numbers, and so would a Dolt with a different chunk store configuration.
