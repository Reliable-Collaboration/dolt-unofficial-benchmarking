"""Project how long a full run will take, from rates that were measured rather than guessed.

  python3 scripts/estimate.py [--repeat 3] [--repeat-budget 180]

Every rate here comes from a load this project actually performed, and each is named with the
database it was measured on so it can be checked or replaced. Two things make the projection
trustworthy enough to plan with, and one makes it a projection rather than a forecast:

  * the per-row-commit rate is the important one, because that phase is most of the run, and it is
    also the steadiest thing measured: `employees` held 300 rows a second across 350,000 rows with
    the window rate drifting only from 308 to 297.
  * the row-by-row rates agree across databases of very different shapes -- one-INSERT-per-row came
    to 844 rows/s on `chinook` and 819 on `dvdstore`, and MySQL row-wise to 2,198 and 2,044 on
    `chinook` and `adventureworks`.
  * the one-shot loads are dominated by fixed cost, not by rows, so their rate is the least
    meaningful number here. They are also a rounding error in the total.

The fixed cost per unit is real and is counted: every MySQL load starts a brand-new server and waits
for it, and every repeat pays that again.
