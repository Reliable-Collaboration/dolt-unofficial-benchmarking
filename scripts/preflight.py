"""Load every database's schema into both engines before spending hours on the rows.

  python3 scripts/preflight.py [--only sakila] [--indexes deferred|inline|both]

Four faults in this experiment were found by a full run failing partway through, each after
somewhere between twenty minutes and six hours of loading:

  * `ERROR 1100: Table 'album' was not locked with LOCK TABLES` -- the deferred rebuild landed
    inside mysqldump's `LOCK TABLES` block.
  * `ERROR 1049: Unknown database 'oracle_hr'` -- a view selecting from another database.
  * `ERROR 1075: Incorrect table definition` -- a deferred key that an AUTO_INCREMENT column
    needed.
  * `ERROR 1146: Table 'dvdstore.reorder' doesn't exist` -- the rebuild placed ahead of an empty
    table's `CREATE TABLE`.

Every one of them is a fault in the *schema* half of the file, and every one of them reproduces in
seconds if the rows are left out. Worse, three of the four were cases where **MySQL refused the
file and Dolt accepted it** -- so a run that only checked Dolt, or only checked that something
loaded, would have gone on comparing two engines that were no longer being given the same schema.

So this strips the `INSERT`s and loads what is left into both engines, and reports three things
separately: what MySQL refused, what Dolt refused, and -- the one that matters most here -- where
the two disagreed. It takes about a minute per policy across all 21 databases.

It is not a substitute for the run's own row-count verification, which is the only thing that can
catch a load that goes short. It is the cheap check that comes first.
