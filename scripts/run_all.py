"""Run the whole experiment, timing every load, and record progress as it goes.

  python3 scripts/run_all.py [--only sakila] [--phase dolt_rowcommit] [--restart]

The first version of this experiment measured only size. Time is the other half of the answer — a
storage format that is a fifth the size but takes twenty times as long to load is a different
proposition — so every load here is timed on a wall clock, in both engines, from the same dumps.

**Five loads of every database:**

| key | engine | how the rows are written |
|---|---|---|
| `mysql` | MySQL 9.7.2 | mysqldump's extended `INSERT`s |
| `mysql_rowwise` | MySQL 9.7.2 | one `INSERT` per row |
| `dolt_oneshot` | Dolt 2.3.2 | extended `INSERT`s, one commit for the database |
| `dolt_rowinsert` | Dolt 2.3.2 | one `INSERT` per row, one commit for the database |
| `dolt_rowcommit` | Dolt 2.3.2 | one `INSERT` per row, one commit **per row** |

MySQL is loaded into a **fresh, empty server** rather than read from the megasamples image, so both
engines are timed and sized from the same input under the same conditions. `mysql_rowwise` is the
honest counterpart to Dolt's per-row loads: MySQL commits every autocommitted statement, so one
`INSERT` per row is one durable transaction per row, which is the closest thing MySQL has to what
Dolt does with a commit per row.

**Designed to be watched.** Every unit of work writes `build/progress.json` the moment it finishes,
so `python3 scripts/progress.py` says what is done, what is running, how long it has taken and what
is left. The run is resumable: a unit already recorded is skipped, so it can be stopped and picked
up. Units run cheapest-first and smallest-first within a phase, so the results table fills in from
the top rather than arriving all at once at the end.

    sample: a fifteen-hour load sampled twice a second from outside would spend hours of CPU on
    process creation and perturb the timings it is there to explain.

    `anon` is the number that matters. The cgroup limit counts anonymous memory and page cache
    together, but the kernel reclaims cache under pressure and cannot reclaim anon, so it is anon
    that decides whether a process is killed. `memory.peak` would be the natural source and is not
    usable here: the container is long-lived and shared across loads, so its high-water mark is
    whatever the largest earlier load reached, and the reset that would fix that is refused from
    inside the container.

    The loop's PID is kept in a file and the previous loop is stopped by it. It used to be stopped
    with `pkill -f memsampler`, a pattern that also matched the shell issuing it, and the loops of
    earlier loads were left running in the worker (2026-10-04)."""
