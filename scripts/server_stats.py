"""Measure what a running `dolt sql-server` adds to a database directory, without disturbing the
measurement of the database itself.

  python3 scripts/server_stats.py

The size figures everywhere else in this repository come from a run with **no server** — the load is
done by the `dolt` CLI and nothing serves the data afterwards. That is deliberate: a server that has
served a database leaves things behind in its directory, and mixing the two states is how an earlier
version of this experiment ended up reporting a total that moved by 68 MB between runs for no
apparent reason.

So this measures the server's contribution separately and on a **copy**, which is the only way to
have both numbers without one changing the other:

  1. copy `data/dolt` to `data/dolt-served`
  2. start a server on the copy and run one query against every database, so it collects statistics
  3. stop the server and measure `.dolt/stats` per database

The result is recorded as `server_stats_bytes` and reported in its own section. It is real disk that
a real deployment will use; it is just not the size of the data.
